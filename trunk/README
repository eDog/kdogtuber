Hi and welcome to the trunk folder of the KDogTuber project.

In this folder you can get the lates source code with all the changes that aren't in the release version.

Everyone can contribute at the project coding some new feature or fixing some bugs, but if you want to make big changes to the project,
you should create a new branch and working to that.

Have fun.
